Then, it re-imports the Excel file that was generated during the export test to restore the graph to its prior structure and content. After restoring the data, the script deletes the exported Excel file to clean up the working directory. Finally, it prints a confirmation message indicating that the file has been deleted and all tests were successfully completed. This ensures the environment is left in a clean and consistent state."
