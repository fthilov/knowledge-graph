First, it imports all necessary libraries, including time for measuring execution duration, pandas for handling Excel data, and a set of helper functions defined elsewhere in the project. A timer is started to track the total runtime of the script. Then, a connection to the Neo4j database is established using the `init_connection()` function. After that, the script loads the Excel file `data/knowledge_graph.xlsx`, which contains the structured data that will be used to create the nodes and relationships of the knowledge graph."
